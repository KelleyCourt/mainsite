        "Title": "Do I Need a Lawyer?",
        "BlockText": "No. You do not have to have a lawyer when you go to court. In California, several hundred thousand people each year go to court without a lawyer. This is called being in \"pro per\" -- the legal term for a person representing him or herself without a lawyer. However, some cases are complicated. This is when a lawyer can be most helpful.  You may find that you need a lawyer if:   \tanyone involved has an estate with substantial assets; \tanyone involved lives outside of California; \tthere are some other legal proceedings going on at the same time; \tanyone involved has special needs (physically/emotionally disabled); \tanyone involved is a member of the armed services, or \tanyone involved is Native American (in which case, federal laws may apply).   Lawyers are trained to research the intent of laws and judicial decisions and apply the law to the specific circumstances you face. In addition to skills in legal research, a lawyer will usually have:   \tfamiliarity with courtroom rules and procedures; \tan understanding of when a witness is needed, and how he or she should be prepared for a trial; \tan understanding of when an expert, consultant, or investigator is needed – where to find such a person, and how much is reasonable to pay; and \texperience with different strategies for effective presentation of a case in court.   If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer there are several options that may help.   \tEvery superior court in California has legal help available in family law and in small claims cases. Several superior courts can also help you with other legal issues. Find out what services are available at your court. \tThere are legal aid offices in many cities throughout California. These are non-profit organizations that provide free legal services to people below a certain income level.  Find legal aid offices in your area and find out what areas of law they cover. \tIf you don’t have much money but the other party in your case does, the court might order the other party to pay for some or all of your lawyer’s fees. (You would have to ask the court for this. It is not automatic.) \tMany bar associations have Modest Means Panels made up of lawyers who will take certain kinds of cases for a reduced fee. (You would have to find your local bar association and ask if it could help you with this.) \tYou may be able to find a lawyer who will coach you on representing yourself (called \"coaching\"), or who will only handle (and charge you for) the more complicated parts of your case.  This is called \"limited scope representation\" or \"unbundled legal services.” (Your local bar association may have a list of lawyers who do limited scope representation.)   Generally, lawyers specialize in a particular area of the law. They may specialize in trial law (civil or criminal), bankruptcy law, elder law, family law, etc. When working with a lawyer, it is important to know his or her specialty.  NOTE: A lawyer cannot represent you in Small Claims court but they may help you prepare for your case.  If you decide to hire a lawyer, make sure you understand:   \twhat you will be paying for, \thow much it will cost, and \twhen you will be expected to pay your bill.   You may want to talk to several attorneys before you hire one.   \tGo to the State Bar of California’s Lawyer Referral Service.   You can also find attorneys listed in the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory, or through the internet.   \tGet more help finding free and low-cost legal aid."

        "Title": "Which Court Should I Use: Small Claims or Limited Civil?",
        "BlockText": "There are valid reasons for choosing either Small Claims or Limited Civil court. Each court is a trial court.   Small Claims    \tIn Small Claims court, individuals and sole proprietorships can sue for $10,000 or less. Businesses (other than sole proprietorships) and government agencies can sue for $5,000 or less. \tNobody may bring an attorney (unless there is an appeal).  \tThe court costs are less than Limited Civil court.  \tSmall Claims court is faster.  \tThere is no discovery, and rules of evidence do not apply.  \tA judicial officer (a Judge, Commissioner or Temporary Judge) tries the case; there is no jury.  \tAn appeal is a new trial before a new judge. Therefore, all evidence is presented again.    Limited Civil   \tIn Limited Civil court, you may sue for up to $25,000.00.  \tYou may have an attorney represent you.  \tThere is limited discovery allowed. (Discovery is a way to get information that will lead to evidence or evidence itself that you may use in court.)  \tThe trial is either by the judge or a jury.  \tAppeals are not new trials; therefore, no evidence is offered. Only arguments are presented as to how the trial court applied the wrong law to the case, or misinterpreted one it applied. Appellate judges hear the case on appeal."

        "Title": "What Kinds of Cases are Heard in Small Claims Court?",
        "BlockText": "Most cases are about:    \tCar accidents  \tProperty damage  \tSecurity deposit issues between landlord and tenant \tMoney owed  \tHome or car repair services.    Here are some other kinds of cases heard in small claims court: _________________________________________________________________________  Injuries Caused by Animals, or Injuries to Animals   \tDog bites. \tInjuries caused by a pet.  \tInjuries to a pet or farm animal.   _________________________________________________________________________  Broken Contracts:  A “contract” is an agreement between two or more parties to do something. Contracts may be written, verbal, or implied.  Some examples of broken contracts are:   \tSomeone did not do what he or she agreed to do in the contract.   For example, the contractor did not fix the roof.  Or, the customer did not pay the contractor who fixed their roof. \tSomeone who has a contract with another person tells the person that he or she will break the contract in the future.  \tSomeone promises to do something and the other person believed him or her. Then the first person does not do what he or she agreed to do and this harms the second person.     _________________________________________________________________________  Defamation and Privacy    \tSomeone harms the reputation of someone else in writing, with a picture, or electronic media.  \tSomeone harms the reputation of someone else through speech.  \tSomeone intrudes into someone else's private affairs without permission.  \tSomeone makes public, facts that were private.     _________________________________________________________________________  Emotional Distress    \tSomeone causes extreme personal suffering to someone else, on purpose. \tSomeone causes extreme personal suffering to someone else, because they were not careful.   _________________________________________________________________________  Employment    \tDiscrimination against someone for a protected reason. \tHiring or continuing to employ staff in a negligent way. \tEmployer does not have worker’s compensation insurance policy.  \tDangerous conditions in the workplace.   _________________________________________________________________________  Broken Contracts, or Injuries Caused by a Government Agency or Official    \tLocal or State Government  \tBefore you can file a claim against a government agency, you have to follow that agency’s claim procedures. \t  \t \t\tIf you received a written rejection of your claim by the agency, you have 6 months from the date you received the notice to file your claim.  \t\tIf you do not get a rejection letter, you have 2 years to file from the day the event happened.  \t \t \tThe Federal Government  \tYou cannot sue a federal government agency in Small Claims Court.  To sue the United States government, you may file in a Limited Civil Court or in a Federal District Court.   _________________________________________________________________________  Your Insurance Company    \tThe insurer breaks the written insurance contract.  \tThe insurer does not act in the best interest of the person or business insured.    NOTE:  In California you cannot sue someone else’s insurance company.  _________________________________________________________________________  Intentional Injury Involving a Contract  1. Someone intentionally encourages a person with a contract to break that contract, causing damage to the relationship between the contracting parties.   _________________________________________________________________________  Negligence -- when someone is careless and injures another person or their property, such as:    \tAccidents by a common carrier, like a railroad;  \tMalpractice by a professional;  \tSomeone's children injure someone, or someone’s property (parents may be held responsible);  \tProviding alcohol to people under 21;  \tConditions or activities on a landlord's property injure someone (landlord may be held responsible).   _________________________________________________________________________  Physical Injury    \tTouching another person without permission – it could be violent or not.  \tThreatening to use force on someone else.  \tFalse imprisonment.   _________________________________________________________________________  Property Injury    \tIntentionally taking property without permission.  \tDamaging property accidentally.  \tDamaging property intentionally.   _________________________________________________________________________  Real Estate Broker, Escrow Agent & Notary Public    \tBroker intentionally did not give the purchaser very important information. \tBroker didn’t tell the purchaser about problems the property has.  \tWhen a person who authorized another person to be their agent didn’t deal with their agent fairly.  \tWhen an agent that temporarily holds something of value to two parties to a contract causes harm because of lack of care or not fulfilling his or her duty.   _________________________________________________________________________  Real Property    \tA person intentionally enters onto someone else’s visibly enclosed land illegally. Or, a person causes something to enter another person’s land illegally, such as throwing a rock on purpose at a neighbor’s window. \tIntentionally making a false statement that casts doubt on another person’s ownership of property.  \tCreating a condition that interferes with a person’s enjoyment of his or her property, or creating a condition that interferes with the general public’s use of public property."

        "BlockText": "In Small Claims cases:    \tA person or sole proprietorship cannot ask for more than $10,000 in \ta claim.  \tOther businesses or government agencies cannot ask for more than $5,000.    Special Small Claims Cases:    \tGuarantors  \tA \"guarantor\" is a person or company which promises to be responsible for what another person or company owes.  A guarantor can only be sued for up to $4,000 or $2,500 if they don't charge for the guarantee.  \t  \t \t\tBut, a person filing against the Contractors' State License Board can sue this guarantor for up to $10,000.  \t\t  \t \t \t Multiple Plaintiffs \tIf the case came out of the same event , for example, a car accident where several people were injured, then each person injured may sue for up to the amount allowed.  Some contracts may also include several claims by several plaintiffs. Consider getting advice from an attorney or a Small Claims Advisor if you are not sure if this applies in your case.  \tMultiple Plaintiffs and Defendants \tSome cases involve several defendants and one or more plaintiffs. A plaintiff may have a claim against each defendant for up the amount allowed. Consider getting advice from an attorney or a Small Claims Advisor if you are not sure if this applies in your case.    NOTE:  It is not legal to split an over-the-limit claim into two smaller ones if they come from the same event or transaction.  If you want to claim more than $10,000, you may file in Limited Civil Court.  You may also file in Limited Civil Court if or you are not asking for money, but want the court to order someone to do something.  If you want to claim more than $25,000, you may file in Unlimited Civil Court."

        "Title": "How Many Cases May I File?",
        "BlockText": "In California, you may file as many claims in small claims court as you want for up to $2,500 each.  But you may only file two (2) claims in a calendar year that ask for more than $2,500 (and up to $10,000 if you are an individual or sole proprietor of a business, or up to $5,000 for other businesses).  NOTE 1:  A calendar year is from January 1 of a year to December 31 of that same year.  NOTE 2:  If you file more than 12 other small claims in the state within the previous 12 months, then the filing fee is $100 for each claim you file beginning with the 13th claim. (Keep in mind: “previous 12 months” is different from the “calendar year.”)  NOTE 3:  Government agencies (cities, counties, school districts, etc.,) may file more than two (2) claims in a calendar year if the claims do not exceed $5,000."

        "Title": "What is Mediation?",
        "BlockText": "Mediation is a process for resolving disputes informally.  It is voluntary and confidential.  It works like this:  You and the other person would meet with a third person who is neutral – a trained mediator. That person would help the two of you talk things over in an attempt to resolve your dispute. Usually, mediation of a small claims dispute lasts between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It can be tried before or after filing a lawsuit.    \tMediation can really help if you have an on-going relationship with the person you have the dispute with. If you are suing a family member, neighbor, business partner, landlord, or tenant, mediation may help you work out your problems and keep your relationship.  \tMediation allows people to make their own decisions about how they will resolve their disputes.   If you decide that mediation might resolve your dispute, ask a court clerk if the small claims court offers a mediation program.  If not, the clerk may know of a publicly funded program in your county.  You can also locate a mediation program by looking in the business section of your telephone directory, on the website of the California Department of Consumer Affairs.  If you DO settle your dispute, write down what was agreed to. Include:    \tThe names and addresses of the two people, \tA brief description of the “what,” “when” and “where” of the dispute that has been resolved, \tA statement of what the person giving up a claim is getting in return, \tThe date the agreement is being signed, and \tThe signatures of everyone involved.   Make sure everyone has a copy of the agreement, and keep your copy of the agreement in a safe place."

        "BlockText": "Before you can file a claim in court against a government agency, you have to follow that agency’s claim procedures. (This is called 'exhausting administrative remedies.')     How can I present my claim to the government agency?  Get an official claim form from the agency:   \tIf your claim is against your county government, get the forms from the county clerk. \tIf your claim is against the city government, get the forms from the city clerk. \tIf your claim is against the State of California, contact State Board of Control. Click here for information about filing a claim against the State of California.  \tIf your claim is against another agency, get the forms from that agency.   When do I have to file with the agency?   \tIf you or your personal property [not real estate] was damaged, you have 6 months to file. \tIf your claim is about damage to your real property, you have 1 year to file from the date you knew or should have known about the problem. \tIf your claim is about a contract, you have 1 year to file after the contract was broken.   The agency will tell you if your claim is approved or denied. If you hear nothing it is considered denied after 45 days.  IF the agency denies your claim, you can sue in small claims court.    \tIf you receive a written rejection of your claim by the governmental agency, you have 6 months from the date the notice was personally delivered or deposited in the mail to file the claim.  \tIf you don't get a rejection letter, you have 2 years to file from the day the incident occurred.   What happens after I file in small claims court?  Everything is the same as any other small claims court case.  Name the government agency as the defendant.

        "BlockText": "If you were in a car accident, you may only sue the driver and/or owner of the car that hit you. You may not sue their insurance company.  You may sue for:    \tproperty damage to your car, and  \tpersonal injury.   If there was only property damage  You are limited to suing for:    \tthe costs of repairing the car,  \tthe loss of use of your car – car payments you make while your car is being repaired, rental costs, and deductibles, or for  \tthe amount of money it would take to replace the car (at its value at time of the accident).   If you suffered personal injury  You may ask for:    \tall actual medical costs (doctor’s visits, therapy sessions, and medicines); \t \tNOTE:  It doesn’t matter if you only paid a co-pay, or if your insurance paid it all.  What matters is what you and/or insurance actually paid or will owe.  \tcosts of buying or renting medical appliances (such as crutches);  \tlost wages -- because you have to go to the doctor or for therapy, or because you can’t return to work due to the accident, and  \tpain and suffering. (Add up the actual medical costs.  In small claims it is suggested that you multiply these by 3.)   Your claim would be the total of the amounts of 1 to 4.

        "Title": "I Haven’t Gotten My Security Deposit Back – What Do I Do?",
        "BlockText": "The most common disagreement between landlords and tenants is over the refund of the tenant's security deposit after the tenant has moved out of the rental unit.  California law allows the landlord to use a tenant's security deposit for 4 purposes:   \tFor unpaid rent;  \tFor late fees;  \tFor cleaning the rental unit when the tenant moves out -- but only to make the unit as clean as it was when the tenant first moved in; and  \tFor repair of damages, other than normal wear and tear, caused by the tenant or the tenant's guests.   NOTE:  If the lease or rental agreement allows it, the landlord can also use a tenant’s security deposit for the cost of restoring or replacing furniture, furnishings, or other items of personal property (including keys), other than normal wear and tear.  The tenant’s responsibility: notify the landlord before you move out.    \tIf you pay rent once a month, you have to give your landlord 30 days' notice in writing. If you don't, the landlord can charge you for the unpaid rent. Unless a new tenant pays the rent, you'll have to pay for those 30 days.  \tIf you pay rent every week, you have to give 7 days' notice.   The landlord’s responsibility: inspect the rental unit and allow the tenant to repair any damage.    \tWithin 2 weeks of the date that the tenant is going to move out, the landlord must advise the tenant, in writing, of the right to be present at a walk-through with the landlord. The purpose of the inspection is to allow the tenant an opportunity to repair damage pointed out by the landlord.   After the tenant moves out, the landlord has 21 days to return the security deposit -- or send a list of repairs and receipts or estimates.    \tThe tenant has a right to receive a copy of all receipts for the work done and materials purchased.  \tIf the repairs are going to take more time due to extensive work needed, the landlord should provide copies of the estimates for the work and materials within 14 days. After the work is complete, the landlord has to provide copies of the receipts to the tenant.   If you, the tenant, don't get your deposit back within 21 days write a letter to your landlord.    \tState the amount of the security deposit that you paid, and ask the landlord to return it all to you – or send you a list of repairs made and how much each cost. Ask for copies of the receipts for each repair.  \tKeep a copy of the letter for your records   Get help writing a letter asking a landlord to return a security deposit.  If the landlord does not honor the 21-day rule -- or if the tenant thinks the landlord is keeping too much money for repairs -- the tenant has two options.   1.  Ask for mediation.  Mediation is a process for resolving disputes informally. It is voluntary and confidential. In mediation, the landlord and the tenant would meet with a third person – a neutral, trained mediator. That person would help the two talk things over in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Many disputes that go to mediation are settled outside of court because the people involved have control over the outcome.  2.  File a lawsuit in small claims court  If mediation doesn’t help and there is still no agreement, the tenant can sue the landlord in small claims court. He or she can ask for the deposit plus twice the amount of the security deposit in damages (if the landlord kept the deposit in bad faith)."

        "Title": "I Got a Bad Check – What Do I Do?",
        "BlockText": "A “bad check” is a check that you cannot cash.  There are two kinds of bad checks:    \tNon-Sufficient Funds – the person who wrote the check didn’t have enough money in the account to cover the check.  \tStop Payment -- the person who wrote the check told the bank to stop payment, although there may be money in the bank account to cover it.   NOTE 1:  Sometimes there are valid reasons for stopping payment on a check. For example, the goods or services paid for with the check were never delivered or were defective. Stopping payment for this reason is called a “good faith dispute.”  If you go to court over this and the person who wrote the check can prove that a good faith dispute exists, the judge might not award any damages.  NOTE 2:  A bank may cash a check even if the writer of the check had put a stop payment on it. If the “stop payment” was done orally, such as by phone, the stop payment is only valid for 14 days. If the “stop payment was done in writing, it is valid for 6 months. (“Stop payments” may be renewed.) Therefore, if a bank cashes a check after the “stop payment” time has passed, you cannot sue the bank.  If someone writes you a bad check without a good reason, you can sue for 3 times the amount of the check - up to an additional $1,500 (maximum) - plus the original amount of the check.  If someone stops payment on a check without a “good faith dispute,” you can sue for the amount of the check -- plus 3 times the amount of the check, with a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1,500.  However, BEFORE you can file a “bad check” lawsuit in small claims court, you must:   1.  Send a “demand letter” to the person who wrote the check. Ask the post office to send it by “certified mail” with “return receipt requested” (there will be a fee).  In your letter, demand to be paid within 30 days -- by cash or money order -- the following amounts:    \tthe amount of the check,  \tthe cost of certified mail and  \tthe service fee, charged by your bank, of up to $25 (and up to $35 for each subsequent check).   See a sample “Bad Check\" demand letter.  See a sample \"Stop Payment\" demand letter.  2.  Then wait 30 days. If you are paid within the 30 days, your dispute is resolved. (You cannot sue for the check or for bank fees or for “statutory damages.”)  3  File your lawsuit. If you are not paid in 30 days, you can ask the court to order the other side to pay you the full amount of the check, plus the cost of certified mail, plus your bank fees, plus the “statutory damages” of 3 times the amount of the check, with a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1,500.   4.  Attend your court hearing.  Be sure to take:    \tA copy of the demand letter you sent.  \tProof from the post office that you sent the letter certified mail.  \tAny other papers you need to prove your case. For example, bank statements, notes about your conversations, or any other letters to or from the check writer."

        "BlockText": "California’s Department of Consumer Affairs has a Bureau of Automotive Repair to help keep repair shops from taking advantage of people. If you're unhappy with work done on your car, you can file a complaint with the Bureau.  Before you file a complaint  Talk to the person in charge of service or repairs at the shop. Keep these tips in mind:   \tBe polite and stay calm. \tExplain your problem. \tTell the person in charge what you think is a fair settlement. \tTell the person if you are willing to negotiate. \tIf you can't work it out, tell the person you're going to consider all of your legal options, including filing a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repair.    TIP: As soon as you start to think that you may need help solving this problem with the repair shop – either from the Bureau of Automotive Repair or the court:   A. Start to organize your evidence that the repair shop did a bad job.    \tSave all of your receipts, \tGet your used car parts, if you haven’t already (California law requires that your used parts be returned to you upon request), \tMake notes of every visit or phone call – date, time, what was said, etc.   B. Have your car checked by an expert.    \tBefore you drive many miles, have your car checked by an experienced mechanic. Ask him or her to write a letter stating his or her experience, training, and what, in his or her opinion, is wrong with the car. (You may need to pay a mechanic to do this.)  \tGet 3 estimates of how much it will cost to repair your car. You will use these to prove the amount it will take to get your car fixed. If you have already fixed the car, provide that receipt as evidence of costs.   To file a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repair:  Go to their website to file a complaint.  What happens after you file with the Bureau?  You'll get a postcard telling you your case number and the name of your Bureau representative.   \tThe representative will try to work things out with the repair shop for you. \tYou will get phone calls and letters with information about your case.   What if you can't work things out?  If the shop broke any laws, the Bureau will get proof.  Then they may give the shop a \"Notice of Violation.\"   \tYou will be told when your case is closed.   NOTE: The Bureau can't represent you in court or collect money for you.  If the Bureau of Automotive Repair cannot help you, you can sue the repair shop in small claims court."

You can sue for up to $10,000 if you’re an individual or sole proprietor, and up to $5,000 if you are a company other than a sole proprietorship.  You have 4 years from the date of the problem to file your lawsuit.  You have 10 years, if the problem was hidden and it took time to find out about the problem.  2.  File with the California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) File a case if you want to complain against the contractor.  This has other consequences for the contractor, including a possible fine up to $15,000.   \tThe CSLB investigates complaints against both licensed and unlicensed contractors. \tThe CSLB can review complaints about contractors’ work up to 4 years from the date of the problem.  They can review complaints up to 10 years after the problem if the problems were hidden and it took time to find out about the problem.

Licensed Contractors – You may sue in small claims court or file a complaint with the CSLB for:    \tWork that was done wrong;  \tWork that was not finished or finished on time;  \tUnpaid subcontractors, material suppliers or employees;   \tNot following building code requirements, not getting the required permits, etc.; or, \tFalse, misleading or deceptive advertising   Unlicensed Contractors – You may sue in small claims court or file a complaint with the CSLB for the same issues as licensed contractors, plus for being unlicensed.  It is illegal to contract to do home repairs or remodeling without a license for more than $500 including labor and materials. Therefore, if you file in small claims court you may ask for any money you paid beyond $500 up to the limit for small claims cases.  Check on the License To see if the contractor is licensed or not, check with the Contractors State License Board.  Your Judgment  If you win a judgment against a licensed contractor, you may file a copy of the judgment with the CSLB. If the judgment is due to a repair, remodel or construction issue, the CSLB may suspend the contractor’s license until the judgment is paid.   \tLearn how to file a case in small claims court. \tFile a complaint with the Contractors State License Board."

This unit decides claims that people have about their wages.    \tFor help, check out the California Department of Industrial Relations. \tSee a list of their local offices in California.   Wage Claim Adjudication Unit Workers can file claims with this unit if they are not paid their wages at a regular time, or if they are not paid for overtime, or for vacation pay as described under California Labor Code, Sections 96 and 98.   To file a complaint with the unit for Wage Claim Adjudication: Go to their website and click on File a Wage Claim. Follow the instructions they provide.  What happens after you file your complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement?    \tThe Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) deputies will hold an informal conference between you and your employer to resolve your wage dispute. \tIf you cannot solve the problem at the informal conference, the DLSE will hold an administrative hearing to decide the matter.   If the Wage Claim Adjudication unit cannot help you, you can sue your employer in small claims court for the work done but not paid for.   If you decide to file a complaint with the Wage Claim Adjudication unit before you file a lawsuit in small claims court, make sure that your time to file a claim in court (‘statute of limitations’) doesn’t run out.   \tUsually, you have 2 years to file your case in court from the date you were to be paid. \tIn some instances, you may have up to 4 years to file in court if you have an employment contract in writing.   If your problem isn’t resolved by the DLSE about 6 months before the time to file in court runs out, seriously think about filing in court at that time."

If you only learn the defendant's correct name later, you can ask the judge to change your claim at the hearing. You also can file a request with the court to change the judgment at any time to show the correct name.  If you're not sure which of several possible defendants caused the problem, name each person or business you believe is responsible. The court will decide which defendant you named is legally responsible.  Here are some examples of ways to name a defendant:    \t An individual — Write the first name, middle initial, and last name. For example: \"John A. Smith.\"  \t \t\tIf an individual has more than one name, list all of them separated by the words \"also known as\" or \"aka\". For example: “John A. Smith aka Jack Smith.” \t \t \tA business owned by an individual — Write the names of both the owner and the business. Example: \"John A. Smith, individually and doing business as Smith Carpeting, a sole proprietorship.\"  If you win your case, you can enforce your court judgment against both the individual and the business. \tA business owned by two or more individuals — Write the names of both the business and all of the owners that you can identify.  Example: \"John A. Smith and Mary B. Smith, individually and doing business as Suburban Dry Cleaning, and Suburban Dry Cleaning, a partnership.\"  Then, you can collect from the assets of either the business or an individual owner if you win your case.  \tA corporation or limited liability company — Write the exact name of the corporation or limited liability company.  Check the Secretary of State website for the legal name.  You don’t name any person for a corporation (or LLC). For example: \"Fourth Dimension Graphics, Inc., a California corporation.\" \t \t\tIf the corporation operates through a division, corporate subsidiary or fictitious business name, both should be listed. For example: \"Eastern Quality Petrol, a Delaware corporation, doing business as Fast Gas.\" \t \t \tA vehicle accident defendant —Write the names of the registered owner or owners, and the driver.

So if you want to sue someone who lives and works in Nevada, you will have to sue in Nevada courts -- because an out-of-state resident cannot be served outside of California.  There are two exceptions to the general rule that out-of-state residents cannot be served outside of California:  1. If the case has to do with California real estate and the owner lives out-of-state, the owner can be sued in California courts and served in their home state, and  2. People who are involved in a car accident on a public road in California, and own the car, may be served no matter where they live. To do this, papers must be served on both the out-of-state defendant and the California Department of Motor Vehicles.  Also, out-of-state residents can be served with California court papers if they visit California.  Rules for starting a small claims case are different from state to state. You will need to find out about the law in the state you are suing in.  Usually, you can do some of this by looking at that state’s court website.   \tCheck to see if there are small claims courts in the state where the person you want to sue lives. \tCheck to see if the state in which you wish to file the small claims suit allows documents to be filed by mail or online, and how to pay the fee to file.  \tCheck to see if attorneys are allowed at the trial there.

        "BlockText": "The small claims court usually only settles disputes about money.  Generally, it cannot order the other side to do something - or stop doing something.  If you do not want money, but only want the trees trimmed, or to have the dog stop barking, or to have the car you loaned someone returned, then probably small claims court is not for you. It might be better for you to sue in the court of limited jurisdiction (or the court of unlimited jurisdiction if the property you want returned is worth more than $25,000).  Or, you might try mediation.  However, the small claims court does have the power to give a conditional judgment. (See California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 116.610)   In a conditional judgment the court can order someone to do or stop doing something by a certain time or pay a specific amount of money -- without a further act by the court.  You can ask for a conditional judgment on your Plaintiff’s Claim and ORDER to Go to Small Claims Court (Form SC-100):   In question number 3a – “Why does the Defendant owe the Plaintiff money?” -- put the words ‘I want a conditional judgment.” (after you put in why the defendant owes you money).  TIP:  You might also remind the court at the beginning of the hearing that you are asking the court for conditional judgment, if you win the case.  REMEMBER: In a conditional judgment the defendant may choose to do or not do something.  If the defendant chooses not to do what you want within the time set by the court (usually 2 weeks), he or she is choosing to pay the money instead.  For example, if someone borrowed a ring from you that is not worth much money but has a lot of sentimental value, the defendant may choose not to give the ring back to you within 2 weeks as ordered. A small claims court cannot make the defendant return the ring. It can only order that if the defendant doesn’t return the ring, he or she must pay you for the ring by including the sum owed in the same judgment. Therefore, you may not get the result you wanted. Now you only have a money judgment to enforce – you may not get your ring.  To get an order to get your ring back, you need to sue in the court of limited jurisdiction instead. Or, you can try discussing the matter with a mediator’s help to see if you can resolve the dispute another way."

For it to be valid, substituted service must be done at least 25 days before the court hearing (or 30 days, if the hearing is in a county different from where the service took place). The days are counted from the day your server mailed the 2nd copy of the papers to the defendant. See below.  If the person you have to serve is not at home or work when your server goes there, your server can give the court papers to:    \tA competent adult (at least 18) who appears to be living at the home with the person to be served, or  \tAn adult who seems to be in charge where the person to be served usually works, or  \tAn adult who seems to be in charge where the person receives mail (including a private mailbox, but not a U.S. Postal Service P.O.

Check with the Secretary of State for the name of the agent of service of process and the legal name of the corporation.  2.  If the company does have an office or store in California, you may have the general manager of that office or store served.  REMEMBER:  Your defendant is the business, not the manager. The manager is just who you serve. See How to Serve a Business or Public Entity (Small Claims) (Form SC-104C) for more help.  3.  If the out-of-state company does business in California but has not registered an agent for service of process, then the court may order the California Secretary of State be served for the out-of-state company.    You have to get a court order before serving the Secretary of State for the out-of-state company.  To get the court order you have to prove to the court in your request that:  (a) You took steps to look, but could not find an authorized agent for service of process;  (b) You believe that the company does enough business in California to require them to have an agent for service. Ads targeting California residents would be useful to prove this.  NOTE:  You must personally serve the court order and Plaintiff's Claim (Form SC-100) on the Secretary of State. You must include $50.00, payable to the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State will serve the out-of-state company by forwarding the copy of the Plaintiff’s Claim to the company's main executive office.  If the Secretary of State does not have an address for the company's main executive office, it can forward the Plaintiff’s Claim  to the last known agent for service of process.  If the Secretary of State has no valid address, it cannot do anything.  4.  If none of the above work, you will have to go to the company's home state to sue it there.  Check to see if that state has a Small Claims Advisor to help you."

If you do not know why you are being sued, contact the plaintiff immediately and ask for an explanation.    \t The plaintiff’s name and address are on the Plaintiff’s Claim (Form SC-100) that was given to you.   There are a number of possibilities, including:    \tIt may be a case of wrong identity. The plaintiff may be suing the wrong person or business, or the papers may have been served on the wrong person or business.  \tThere may be a misunderstanding. If you know the plaintiff, he or she may not have understood how you propose to pay. Or perhaps a payment you made was not recorded.   If you believe that this lawsuit is a mistake there are several things you can do.    \tAsk the plaintiff to dismiss (cancel) the case with prejudice – if you are the wrong person or business.  \tAsk the plaintiff to dismiss (cancel) the case with without prejudice  – if you are the right person and you and the plaintiff can agree on how and when you are going to pay the debt.   If the plaintiff refuses to dismiss the claim for some reason:   \tYou can file a request to dismiss the case (see Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice). \tOr, you can write a letter to the court, explaining that you are the wrong person or business being sued.  If the judge agrees, he or she could dismiss the case. \t \t\tWhen you file your request or mail your letter to the court, be sure to have a copy of your paperwork served on the plaintiff.  The service can be by mail. (See How Service is Done.) \t \t \tIf you are the right defendant and fully intend to pay the debt in payments, you can try to persuade the plaintiff to go to mediation to set up an agreement and payment plan. (See What is Mediation?)  Most neighborhood dispute resolution centers offer mediation services.

        "Title": "If I Want to Sue the Plaintiff Back",
        "BlockText": "If you are the defendant and the plaintiff owes you money or hurt you, you can sue the plaintiff back now. This is called \"countersuing,\" or filing a defendant’s claim.  NOTE:  If you don’t want to sue now, you can choose to sue later – as long as the statute of limitations  has not run out in your case. However, it is often better to sue back at the same time and put both cases before the same judge to avoid conflicting judgments.  Before you file your countersuit, ask the plaintiff to pay the money you are owed.    \tGet help writing a letter to the person or business asking for payment. \tGet help writing a letter for a bad check or a stop-payment check. \tYou can only countersue those who have sued you. For example, if you were only sued by the partnership then you cannot countersue both the partnership and a partner.  \tYour claim does not have to be related to the plaintiff’s claim.  A defendant’s claim could be a dispute about an entirely different problem.  \tThe same rules apply to the defendant’s claim as apply to the plaintiff’s claim.  To read about who can use the small claims court, limits of time and place, etc., read the section called Before You Start a Court Case.   If you are the defendant and want to sue the plaintiff back now in the small claims case take the following steps:  Step 1. Get and fill out:   \tDefendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff (Small Claims) (Form SC-120)    Make photocopies of the form – one copy for you and one for each plaintiff you are suing back. (The court will keep the original.)  Step 2. File the original Defendant’s Claim (SC-120) at court.  Also include your photocopies so they can be stamped by the court clerk to become “conformed.”  You can file your court forms in one of three ways:    \tIn person (By visiting the courthouse, handing the forms to the clerk yourself and paying the appropriate filing fee.)  \tBy mail (This process can be slower than filing in person if you have made mistakes in completing the forms.)   TIP:  If you file by mail, include a stamped, self-addressed envelope with enough postage so the court can mail your copy of the forms back to you.  Also, write a simple letter to the court clerk explaining what you are mailing to the court and why.  Be sure to include the fess for filing and service.   \tBy hiring a forms filing service (For a fee, some companies will take your forms to the courthouse and make sure they are filed and that the filing fees are paid. These companies are called “attorney services” and can be found in the yellow pages of your phone book.)   Step 3. Serve a copy of the filed-stamped copy of the Form SC-120 on the plaintiff.  This must be done at least 5 \"court\" days before your court hearing date.  (“Court days” are Monday through Friday. Court days do not include Saturday, Sunday, or holidays.)  NOTE:  You may not serve the court documents on the plaintiff yourself.   \tYou have to have someone over the age of 18, not a defendant in the case, serve the plaintiff. The person may be a relative or a friend.  \tYou can also hire a professional server. Look in the yellow pages or contact your local bar association for service of process or process servers. If you think you are going to have problems with the other person, use a professional server.   There are three ways copies of your counterclaim can be \"served\":    \tPersonal Service (A person over 18 who is not a defendant in this case delivers a copy of the forms to the plaintiff in person at least 5 days before your court hearing date.) \tService by Mail (The court clerk sends a copy of the claim by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must sign and return a receipt to the clerk. There is a fee for this type of service.)   If the court clerk mails the claim to the plaintiff, it must be mailed 10 days before your court hearing date.   \tSubstituted Service: Someone over 18 - not you or another defendant in the case - must leave a copy of the claim with someone in charge at the plaintiff's office, or with a competent adult who is at least 18 years old at the plaintiff's home.  \tYour server must tell that person \"this is a small claims lawsuit against [name of plaintiff]; please be sure to give it to [name of plaintiff].\"  \tYour server must write down the name of the person to whom he or she gave the court papers. Or, if that person’s name is not known, your server should be able to describe him or her in the Proof of Service (see below).  \tThen your serve must mail another copy of the claim to the plaintiff at the same address where he or she left the first copy of the claim. Service is considered complete 10 days after mailing.   Step 4. Tell the court that you have served your forms.  Your server should complete a:   \tProof of Service (Form SC-104)    Then you should file this form with the small claims clerk before the hearing.  Next, you should prepare for your hearing."

Other courts may use different vendors, or have other steps you must follow.   2.  If testimony by telephone is allowed, be sure to prepare your witness as if he or she were going to be in the courtroom. He or she should be ready to state:  For an eyewitness:    \tHis or her legal name and address  \tThe date of the event that was witnessed  \tWhat he or she saw, heard, smelled, felt or tasted – and when and how he or she did so.   For an expert witness:    \tHis or her legal name and address  \tHis or her work and education credentials, which show his or her expertise in the field being commented on.  \tWhat he or she did related to the situation to be able to render an opinion.  \tWhen he or she did this.  \tHis or her conclusions.  \tIf possible, an estimate of the cost to redo the work properly.  \tAny other facts that might be important in this dispute."

        "Title": "If Evidence You Need is Held by the Other Side",
        "BlockText": "In California, if you want an opposing party to take evidence to the hearing that he or she has in their possession you can write a letter to them with this request and file this letter in court.  In legal terms, such a letter is called a “Notice in Lieu of Subpoena.”  There is no form for this request.  NOTE:  In small claims court, you cannot use a Subpoena (Form SC-107) to ask the other side to bring evidence to the hearing. This is because subpoenas are only for people who are not a plaintiff or defendant in the case, such as witnesses or record keepers.  For a “Notice in Lieu of Subpoena”  Step 1.  Write a letter to the person or business that has the evidence you need.    \tTitle the letter “Notice in Lieu of Subpoena.”  \tAsk the other side to take the specific documents (or other evidence) that you need to prove your case to the court hearing.  \tMake 2 copies of the letter. Make one copy for your files and one copy for the court.   Step 2.  Serve the letter to the other side who has the documents or items.  This service may be done by you, or by another adult.    \tIf the letter is mailed, it must be mailed at least 25 days before the hearing date.  \tIf the letter is delivered in person, it must be personally served at least 20 days before the hearing date.   Step 3.  Inform the court that the letter was provided to the other side.   \tGet a copy of the Proof of Service (If by mail, use Form POS-030. If in person, use Form POS-020). \tFill out the form. Have the person who served the letter (either you or another adult) sign the form. \tMake a copy of the Proof of Service (Form POS-030 or POS 020) for your file.   Step 4. File a copy of the letter and the completed Form POS-030 or POS 020 with the court.  NOTE:  If the other side objects (in writing), the court may have a separate hearing before the trial to decide whether or not the other side has to bring the documents or items you requested on the day of the trial.  Or, the court may decide without scheduling a separate hearing. The court will let you know its decision in writing."

        "Title": "How Can I Subpoena a Witness?",
        "BlockText": "In California, you can ask the court to order a witness to show up at the hearing to testify.  Normally you would just ask the person to appear at the hearing as a witness.  But your witness may need proof that he or she is testifying for you in court on a specific day in order to get approval to miss work.  Or you may really need testimony from a reluctant witness.  TIP:  You probably would not want to make a witness go to court unless he or she has already agreed to testify.  Dragging someone into court who doesn’t want to be there could set him or her against you. See if you can get the evidence you need from another source before getting a subpoena for a reluctant witness.  A “subpoena” is a court order that says that your witness has to go to court.  It can also be used to tell someone to send or bring specific documents or items to court for your hearing. There is a special court form to use for these orders.  (Use the same form for witnesses, documents or items.)  To subpoena a witness  Step 1.  Get your court form. Use:   \tSmall Claims Subpoena for Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things at Trial or Hearing and Declaration (Form SC-107) \tIf you are requiring a person to go to court, fill out page 1 only.  \tIf you are also requesting the person to take documents, complete pages 1 and 2.  \tIn either case, you will fill out page 3 later.   NOTE:  You need to know the name of the witness who you want to go to court.  Step 2.  Take the form to the court (the court “issues” the subpoena).  Take the Subpoena (Form SC-107) to the court filing window.  The clerk will look at the form and may ask you a few questions.  If everything is in order, the clerk will sign and stamp the original form and give it back to you (called “issuing the subpoena”).  Make 2 copies of the completed pages.  Make one copy for your files and one copy for the person you are subpoenaing.  Step 3.  Give a copy (not the original) of the form to the person being subpoenaed at least 20 days before the court hearing.   Any adult – even you -- can deliver the subpoena to the person you want to be your witness. However, it must be by personal service.  You cannot mail the subpoena to the witness, or use any other form of service.  Step 4.  Inform the court that the copy was provided to the witness.  After the subpoena has been given to the person you want to be your witness, have the server (you or someone else) fill out page 3 of the original of Form SC-107.  This page is called: “Proof of Service of Small Claims Subpoena for Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things at Trial or Hearing and Declaration.”    \tMake a copy of page 3 for your files. \tAt least 5 days before your trial hearing, return the entire original Subpoena to the court.   NOTE 1:  Witnesses can ask for $35 a day, plus 20¢ a mile each way, at the time you serve the subpoena.  Be prepared to pay the witness fees.  Make a receipt for the witness to sign, if possible.    \tForm SC-107 lets the witness know that they have a right to these fees. One day’s fees must be paid when you serve the subpoena if the witness asks for them.  \tIn small claims court, the hearings only last one day. So if the witness asks for the money and you don’t pay it, then the witness does not have to show up at your hearing.  \tIf you win the case, you may be able to recover your witness fees from the other side. You will have to ask the court at the end of the hearing to order the losing side to pay these fees.   NOTE 2:  Different fees apply to witnesses who are police officers or firefighters.  The fee for them is $150 or higher per day.  Serve the subpoena and pay the fees to the precinct or fire house where the officer or firefighter is stationed."

If you request consumer or employee records – for example, for bank, medical, insurance or education records – the consumer or employee has the right to know about the request.  He or she also has the right to ask the court to not allow, or to limit, your request.  To let the consumer or employee know about your request for these records, send a copy of the request to him or her at least 10 days before you send the actual request to the record keeper who has the records. See below.  A “subpoena” is a court order.

In addition to the form, you must include a written Notice that you are asking for these records. Here is a sample of a notice:  “Notice to Consumer (or Employee):        “I am asking for records from the record keeper named on the Subpoena Duces Tecum (Form SC-107, page 2), who holds consumer (or employee) records about you. Your records may be protected by a right of privacy. If you object to the record keeper’s providing those records to the court, you may file papers with the court, at least 5 days before the hearing date, to stop the subpoena (a ‘motion to quash”) or to limit the documents requested (a “motion to modify”).        “If you ask me to cancel or change my subpoena and I don’t agree in writing to do so, you should consider consulting an attorney about your privacy rights.”   If the consumer or employee objects to these records being given to the court as you are requesting, he or she will have to file a motion (a request) to have your subpoena stopped. This is called filing a “Motion to Quash.”  (Or they may file a “Motion to Modify” to limit the documents released to the court.) He or she will serve this Motion on you.  The court may have a separate hearing before the trial to decide whether or not the person or organization being subpoenaed has to bring or send the documents or items you requested on the day of the trial. Or, the court may make a decision without scheduling a separate hearing. The court will let you and the other side know in writing.  If the consumer or employee did not file a “Motion to Quash” (or a Motion to Modify) within 10 days after you served Form SC-107 on him or her (call the court clerk to find out), or if the court denied the Motion to Quash, then you may serve the subpoena to the keeper of the customer or employee records.  Step 4.  Give a copy (not the original) of the form to the record keeper at least 10 days before the court hearing.

To learn if there is a specific form for a motion you want to make, check with your Small Claims Advisor.  If there is no special form for the motion you want to make in small claims court, you can use the general form listed below and take the following steps:  Step 1.  Get and fill out your court forms.  For most motions, you may use the:   \t Request for Court Order and Answer (Form SC-105)    At the same time, get a copy of the:   \tOrder on Request for Court Order (Form SC-105A)    Leave this form blank – except for the information about the parties in the case, in the top portion of page 1. Include this SC-105A when you file your Form SC-105. The clerk and court will fill out the rest of Form SC-105A – the Order.  Fill out Form SC-105, except for the boxes which instruct the clerk to fill in (or sign). Pay special attention to:    \tQuestion 3:  Since this is a general form, be sure to tell the court specifically what you want.  \tQuestion 4:  Tell the court why you are asking it to do what you are requesting. \t \t\tIf you need more space than is provided in Question 4, attach a Declaration (Form MC-031) and write ‘See attached Declaration’ in #4, instead of your reasons.  \t\tPut the reasons for your request on the Declaration (Form MC-031). \t \t   Make copies of Form SC-105, any declarations, and any documents that will help you prove to the court why it should decide in favor of doing what you are requesting.

For example, if you are asking the court to dismiss the case against you because you are the wrong defendant corporation, attach paperwork that shows you are the wrong defendant -- such as a blank original of company letterhead or a declaration of a witness.   Your witness can make his or her Declaration on (Form MC-030).   Step 2.  Inform the other side (service of process). You will have to give or mail a copy of the forms and attached documents and/or declarations to the other side before or on the same day that you file the paperwork, depending on when you are filing the request.    \tBefore the trial hearing:  \t \t\tIf you have served the defendant(s) in the case – you must mail a copy to all of the other parties.  \t\tIf you have not served the defendant(s) – you don’t mail anyone a copy of the paperwork.  \t \t \tAfter the trial hearing: \t \t\tThe court clerk will mail a copy of your motion to all other parties. \t \t   NOTE:  This is different from most service of process.

To ask the court to postpone the hearing   A.  At least 10 days before your hearing date:  Step 1.  Get and fill out your court form:    \tRequest to Postpone Small Claims Hearing (Form SC-110)    Step 2.  File form SC-110 with the court clerk.  NOTE:  You'll have to pay a $10 fee to ask for a continuance.  Step 3.  Serve  – by mail or in person -- a copy of your Form SC-110 to the other people named in the claim.  B.  If the hearing is in less than 10 days:   Step 1.  Go to your hearing and ask the judge for a continuance in person. Or, if you absolutely can’t make it to the hearing, take your completed Form SC-110 to the clerk's office.  Ask them to attach it to your file.  In your Request to Postpone Small Claims Hearing (Form SC-110), give the judge a good reason why you are late in filing your request.  NOTE:  You'll have to pay a $10 fee to ask for a continuance.  Step 2.  Also, mail or personally give a copy of your Form SC-110 to the other parties named in the claim.  If the court decides to give you a continuance, it will mail a new date to you and the other parties in the case.  If the court decides NOT to give you a continuance, the case will be heard on the original hearing date. Both sides will be expected to be in court on that original date."

Some ways to try to locate the debtor:    \tUse the Internet and its search tools: white pages, reverse look-up, etc.  \tCheck with the county assessor to see if the debtor, debtor's spouse, or the debtor's domestic partner owns real property. Some county assessors will confirm if a debtor owns real property over the phone.  Find a local tax assessor. \tSearch the county clerk's records to find if the person has a fictitious business name statement on file with an address.  \tCheck with the court to see if there are any other lawsuits filed against the debtor, the debtor's spouse, or the debtor's domestic partner and see if an address is listed in that file."

        "BlockText": "YES. The credit reporting bureaus will know the debtor has a judgment against him or her because the debtor's name will appear on the court's \"Judgment Roll,\" and this is a public record.

When the judgment debt has been paid in full, the debtor can go to court to update his or her credit history."

        "Title": "How is Interest Added to the Unpaid Judgment Debt?",
        "BlockText": "Ten percent (10%) interest per year can be added to the judgment amount from the day it is entered in court until it is paid in full. If partial payments are made, those payments are first applied to the accrued interest and then to the unpaid principal. (See California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections 685.010 to 685.030)  To calculate 10% interest on the judgment debt owed  1.  Figure out the amount of interest that can be charged a day.   Formula: Judgment amount owed x .10 = interest per year Interest per year ÷ 365 (days) = amount of daily interest  Or, said another way:  Take the amount of judgment owed Multiply it by 10% (or 0.10) Divide that number by 365 days (1 year)  The result is the amount of interest that can be charged a day.  Example: Let’s say the judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000.00 (called ‘the principal’) on the judgment.  $5,000.00 x 0.10 = $500.00 $500.00 ÷ 365 = $1.37 a day  The interest will be $1.37 a day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5,000.00.  2.  Figure out the amount of interest owed on the day the judgment debtor pays the debt.  Formula for a lump-sum payment:  Multiply the number of days that have passed since the day the court entered the final judgment to the day of payment x amount of daily interest = amount of interest owed on day of payment.  Or, said another way:  Figure out the number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of payment.  Multiply the days by the amount of daily interest you figured out. The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of payment.  Example: In the above example, if the judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000.00:  The interest owed is $1.37 a day If 72 days have passed since the final judgment, then $1.37 per day X 72 days = $98.64  The judgment debtor owes $98.64 in interest on the principal of $5,000.00.  3.  Add the amount of interest due on the day the judgment debtor pays the judgment debt to the original judgment debt owed.   Example:  Let’s say the judgment debtor is ready to pay $5,000.00 to the judgment creditor 72 days after the final judgment.  $98.64 interest + $5,000.00 debt = $5,098.64.  The judgment debtor owes a total of $5,098.64 on the 72nd day after the court entered the judgment.  To calculate 10% interest on installment payments  Often a judgment debtor will pay all of the money they owe, but not all at the same time.  In this case, the installment payments the debtor made are applied to the interest first and then to the judgment debt (the principal) owed.  Example: After 145 days, the judgment debtor pays $400.00 on the judgment debt of $5,000.00.  1:  Figure out the amount of interest that can be charged.   After 145 days, $198.65 in interest (145 days x $1.37 per day) will have accumulated on the $5,000.00 judgment.  2:  Subtract the interest owed from the debtor’s payment.  The $198.65 interest is paid first. That leaves a $201.35 payment toward the $5,000.00 debt. ($400 - $198.65 = $201.35).  3:  Subtract the remainder of the debtor’s payment from the total debt owed.   Now credit the remaining $201.35 against the $5,000.00 judgment ($5,000.00 - $201.35 = $4,798.65 of unpaid judgment). The judgment debtor now owes $4,798.65 on the judgment.  4:  Figure out the new amount of interest that can be charged.   The new daily interest will then accumulate at a rate of $1.31/day ($4,798.65 x 10% = $479.86 ÷ 365).  Assume then, that 215 days later, a $1,700.00 payment is made.   During the 215 days, $281.65 (215 days x $1.31/day) of interest will have accumulated.  Out of the $1,700.00 received, pay the accumulated interest first ($1,700.00 - $281.65 = $1,418.35) leaving $1,418.35 to apply to unpaid judgment principal.  Now credit the $1,418.35 against the remaining judgment principal of $4,798.65, and we find that $3,380.30 remains unpaid.  The new daily interest will then accumulate at a rate of $0.93/day ($3,380.30 x 10% = $338.03 ÷ 365).  Repeat these calculations until you are completely paid."
